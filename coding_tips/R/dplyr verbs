filter() # use to subset operations based on value: select all events with attendance greater than 20,000
arrange() # change the order of rows: sort your data in ascending order
select() # use to reduce the number of columns in data frame: return a new data frame with only certain columns
mutate() # use to create a new column based on a function of other columns: compute velocity from distance and time in new col
summarise() # use to produce summaries of data: compute the mean of the values in a column
