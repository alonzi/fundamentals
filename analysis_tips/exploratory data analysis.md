for a great intro read: http://r4ds.had.co.nz/exploratory-data-analysis.html

* exploratory data analysis, or EDA for short
* EDA is not a formal process with a strict set of rules. More than anything, EDA is a state of mind.
* Your goal during EDA is to develop an understanding of your data.
> However, two types of questions will always be useful for making discoveries within your data. You can loosely word these questions as:
>1. What type of variation occurs within my variables?
>2. What type of covariation occurs between my variables?

* The best way to spot covariation is to visualise the relationship between two or more variables.
